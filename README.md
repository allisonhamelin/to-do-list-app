# To-Do List
An Android to-do list app inspired by Any.do

At the moment, this app is very simple and lacks a database, but I hope to add one soon. I also plan to add many other features such as a grid containing multiple lists, notifications, the capability for the user to add notes or pictures to a task, and the ability to share lists and tasks with contacts.
