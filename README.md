# Project Name
A personal project: an Android to-do list app inspired by Any.do

At the moment this app is very simple and lacks a database, which I hope to add soon. I also plan to expand the structure, adding a grid containing multiple lists, and add other features such as notifications, and the capability for users to add notes or pictures to their tasks or to share lists/tasks with contacts.
