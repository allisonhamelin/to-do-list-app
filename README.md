# To Do List App
A personal project: an Android to do list app inspired by Any.do

### Notes: 

The app is currently quite simple and lacks a database. Other features that would make the app more complete would be the ability to add more than one list, notifications, capability for users to add notes or pictures to their tasks, and the ability to share lists/tasks with contacts.
